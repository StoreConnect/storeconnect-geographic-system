# Dashboard Demo for StoreConnect

## Description

This project purpose is to demonstrate storeconnect apis and fusion process by displaying on a map raw trajectories from sensors 
and processed data after fusion 

The dashboard is connected to the [storeconnect-sensors-api](https://github.com/StoreConnect/storeconnect-sensors-api) and 
[storeconnect-services-api](https://github.com/StoreConnect/API-Services)

It displays for a chosen date period in circle or lines mode
* the observations generated by storeconnect sensors for multiple subjects exposed through Sensors API
* the trajectories / subjects produced by the fusion process (https://github.com/StoreConnect/storeconnect-fusion) stored in [StoreConnect ontology](https://github.com/StoreConnect/storeconnect-ontologies-api) and expose through Services API  

It uses the [StoreConnect geographic system](https://github.com/StoreConnect/storeconnect-geographic-system) (the sample venue used is SILAB venue)
